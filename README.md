This is a multiplayer snake game.

This game right now supports only single player functionality. But we plan to release the latest version with multiplayer functionality shortly. This game right now supports keyboard inputs with snake moving as: Left arrow key - LEFT Right arrow key - RIGHT Up arrow key - UP Down arrow key - DOWN

The latest game will have two snakes with a score functionality which will provide the score for both of the players.

The latest game will be controlled by: UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT W S D A keys for controlling

The first player to reach the score of 100 will be the winner. There will be only one food item available for both the players in the game.

!!!!!Goodluck and have fun!!!!
